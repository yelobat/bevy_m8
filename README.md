# bevy_dirtywave_m8 - Dirtywave M8 for Bevy.

This plugin provides the ability to make the dirtywave M8 accessible as part of
the running Bevy app.

This is still a work in progress, currently it can render the M8 display. Movement
is also supported around the editor. However, audio is not yet available.
